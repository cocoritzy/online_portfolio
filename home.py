    The internet is an invisible but significant contributor to **global carbon emissions**.

    ### üîç The Problem
    Internet usage is growing at a 26% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), contributing 7% of global electricity consumption and 3.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. If unchecked, Internet-related emissions could reach 14% of global GHG emissions by 2040. Current tools for measuring Internet carbon footprints are often inaccurate, with estimates varying by 5 orders of magnitude.

    ### So... here is what is created
    The Internet Carbon Emission (I.C.E) tool is a real-time Internet carbon footprint analyzer designed to increase user awareness and encourage sustainable behavior. It combines a network traffic analyzer with a machine learning (ML) classifier to track and classify Internet usage, providing personalized feedback on carbon emissions.

    ### How does it work?
    1. Data Collection: The tool uses Wireshark to capture network traffic and nDPI to classify data flows.

    2. Data Transformation: A Random Forest ML model classifies 35 common applications, converting data usage (GB) into carbon emissions (CO‚ÇÇe) based on location-specific energy grids.

    3. Visualization: A web interface displays real-time carbon footprints, personalized tips, and comparisons with peers.

    ### The results
    Video streaming (e.g., YouTube, Netflix) and cloud storage were major contributors to emissions. Personalized feedback and notifications effectively reduced energy consumption.

    st.markdown(""" Can social media influence energy consumption?

    As electricity production generates an important amount of greenhouse gas emissions, rethinking and reducing our electricity consumption is crucial to address climate change issues. 

    This project explored the correlation between my household energy consumption and shared information about climate change shared on Twitter.
    In other words: **Does alarming ‚Äòenergy and climate change‚Äô news impact my household energy consumption behaviour?** 

    ## MY CONCEPT

    **A data-driven approach to energy awareness**:  
    1. **Collect**: Track household energy consumption and climate change-related tweets.  
    2. **Analyze**: Use machine learning to predict energy usage and identify correlations.  
    3. **Actuate**: Send SMS alerts to housemates when energy use exceeds predictions.  
    4. **Visualize**: Provide real-time energy and tweet data via a web app.  

    ## ARCHITECTURE

    1. **Hardware**:ESP32 with a light sensor to track electricity meter flashes.  

    2. **APIs**: Twitter API to collect tweets about "climate change" and "energy" and Twilio API to send SMS alerts.  

    3. **Cloud**: MongoDB for data storage and AWS EC2 for hosting scripts.  

    4. **Data Analysis**: Python (Pandas, ARIMA, SARIMA) for energy predictions.  

    5. **Web App**: Streamlit for real-time data visualization.  
                
    ## DATA COLLECTION & ANALYSIS

    1. **Energy Data**: Collected via ESP32 and light sensor, stored in MongoDB.  

    2. **Twitter Data**: Tweets collected daily via Twitter API, stored in MongoDB.  

    3. **Analysis**:  
       - SARIMA models predict next day‚Äôs energy consumption.  
       - Pearson correlation used to analyze the relationship between energy use and tweets.  

    ## THE RESULTS (SO FAR!)

    - **Correlation**: A slight correlation (Pearson r = 0.37) between energy use and tweets.  
    - **Behavioral Impact**: SMS alerts could influence energy-saving behavior over time.  
    - **Web App**: Real-time energy and tweet data visualized via Streamlit.
