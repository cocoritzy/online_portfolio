    ### üîç The Problem
    Streaming videos, sending emails, and editing documents are all examples of activities that are responsible for an individual‚Äôs ever-increasing data consumption. Several solutions focusing on the IT hardware have been developed in recent years, but the increase of the Internet users‚Äô data consumption lacks attention, becoming a threat to a viable digital future. 
    Internet traffic is predicted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26 % in the coming years . Due to this dramatic growth, Internet data traffic represents already 7% of the global electricity consumption, producing 3.5%, of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this context, if nothing is done, the carbon footprint of total internet traffic could reach 14% of GHG by 2040.
    Two major problems persist:

    - **Lack of awareness:** The carbon footprint of the internet is invisible, making users unaware of its environmental impact.
    - **Inaccurate measurement:** Current tools for measuring internet carbon footprints are often unreliable, with estimates varying by up to five orders of magnitude.

    ### The Internet Carbon Emission Tool (I.C.E)
    For this project I design end-to-end, test, and implement the Internet Carbon Emission (I.C.E) tool. 
    The I.C.E tool is a real-time Internet carbon footprint analyser to encourage behaviour change through increasing user awareness. 
    Built on a network traffic analyser and a machine learning (ML) classifier, the tool can classify up to 35 network applications to display a detailed breakdown of user consumption via a web interface app. 
    The aim of the tool is to promote sustainable behavior and to provide personalized feedback on emissions.

    This model adopts the widest possible system boundaries to capture the total GHG footprint. The results of this model can be segmented into sub-systems to provide greater insight. These subsystems are:

        - Data centers: The energy consumed for data storage and processing.

        - Networks: The energy allocated to data transmission across networks.

        - User devices: The energy used by end users when interacting with a product or service.

    The average UK household uses 6 to 8 kWh of electricity daily[1].
